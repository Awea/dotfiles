"""Stop hook for the ste-writing skill. Lints the final assistant message and
decides what to do about the score.

Why this file is more than one `if`:

The hook runs AFTER the reply is on the reader's screen. A block does not
retract that text - it makes the model send a corrected reply below the first
one, so the reader sees the same answer two times. Version 1 blocked at the
target, so a reply that scored 2.54 against a limit of 2.50 cost a full
duplicate. That trade is wrong.

Version 2 keeps three bands:

  score <= TARGET                    silent pass
  TARGET < score <= BLOCK_AT         warn, no block, no duplicate reply
  score > BLOCK_AT                   block one time for this user turn

A warn goes to a per-session file. The UserPromptSubmit hook reads that file on
the next turn, shows the score, then deletes it. The model learns without a
second reply on screen.

The real fix is in the skill: lint the draft before you send it. Then the gate
stays silent.
